# Tiamblia

With a simple visual style,
Tiamblia is an exploration adventure game
where you talk to spirits, hunt them and gain their powers,
and also there'll be a story and music too.
Maybe even day/night transitions and weather.

Friendly painted beetles,
fancy lions,
a walled garden (that's a snake fyi),
the Spirit of the Hunt,
living lanterns,
tiny birds,
cheeky trees,
and more!
